# neural-style-transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique in deep learning that enables the transfer of artistic style from one image to another while maintaining the structure and objects of the content image. This technique was first introduced by Gatys et al. (2015) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically VGG19. NST has applications in digital art, photo editing, and graphic design. However, this technique faces challenges in maintaining a balance between content and style and is computationally intensive.

This study compares the NST model by Gatys et al. (2015) with the Arbitrary Style Transfer model using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) by Huang et al. (2017). The comparison is performed on several content images, with a focus on result quality, computational efficiency, and generalization ability.
